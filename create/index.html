                <h2>How to create an Ad</h2>
                <p>To create an advertisement on Empties Ads you need to follow these quick steps.</p>
                <h3>1. Join the "Empties" Discord server</h3>
                <p>The first thing you must do is join the Empties Discord server. To do this, create a Discord account if you didn't already and <mark>verify your email</mark>. Then <a href="">join the server</a> and follow the guide (you will be asked to accept the rules and a few other things).</p>
                <h3>2. Create a request for a new Advertisement</h3>
                <p>Now that you joined the Discord server, locate the "Ads" section, go to <discord class="channel">#requests</discord> and create a new post. Follow the guide and write the answer to the questions before posting.<br><em>You may need to wait a maximum of 5 days before the request gets approved. <a href="https://www.empties.it/ds/faq/priorities">Learn more about priorities.</a></em></p>
                <h3>3. How will I know when my request gets approved?</h3>
                <p>You will be notified in the channel <discord class="channel">#approved</discord> in the "Ads" section. You will get the link for the ad if you didn't specify to keep it private. If you specified it the same process will be done but a private thread will be created on the message you would receive. Click on it and you will find the Ad link.</p>
